# Final Fixed Voting NPC System

## IMPORTANT: Fix for Missing Display and Script Errors

If you were having issues with the hologram display not showing up or errors in your previous voting NPC system, these new scripts will fix all problems.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Clear emoji vote display** with üëç and üëé
- ‚úÖ **Highly visible hologram** that's easy to see
- ‚úÖ **10-second cooldown** for changing votes
- ‚úÖ **No duplicate displays or scripts**
- ‚úÖ **Error-free operation**

## Installation Instructions (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Step 1: Remove ALL existing scripts

This is critical to prevent script conflicts:

1. Delete **ANY** existing VotingNPC scripts from ServerScriptService
2. Delete **ANY** existing VotingNPC scripts from StarterPlayerScripts
3. Delete **ANY** existing voting scripts from inside your NPC model

### Step 2: Install the Server Script

1. Download [`VotingNPC_FinalFix.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TopStrixStudios/RobloxVotingNPC/main/VotingNPC_FinalFix.lua)
2. Place it **INSIDE** your NPC model (not in ServerScriptService)
3. Rename it to just `VotingNPC` (remove _FinalFix)
4. Make sure your NPC model has a PrimaryPart (HumanoidRootPart)

### Step 3: Install the Client Script

1. Download [`VotingNPCClient_FinalFix.client.lua`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TopStrixStudios/RobloxVotingNPC/main/VotingNPCClient_FinalFix.client.lua)
2. Place it in **StarterPlayer ‚Üí StarterPlayerScripts**
3. Rename it to just `VotingNPCClient.client.lua` (remove _FinalFix)

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced display visibility**:
   - Larger text with emoji icons
   - Color-coded background based on vote totals
   - Semi-transparent background with outline for better visibility
   - Visible from up to 50 studs away

2. **Continuous display updates**:
   - Display updates every 0.5 seconds
   - Self-repair system recreates the display if it gets removed

3. **Proper script separation**:
   - Server script handles NPC interaction and vote counting
   - Client script only handles UI and inputs

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. Check the Output window for any error messages
2. Make sure you've removed ALL old voting scripts
3. Verify the NPC model has a PrimaryPart
4. Ensure the server script is directly inside the NPC model
5. Ensure the client script is in StarterPlayerScripts

## Debugging Tips

- The display should be visible from 50 studs away
- The display should show "üëç 0 | üëé 0" initially
- When players vote, the numbers should change immediately
- The display should have a semi-transparent background
