# Fixed Vote Persistence for Voting NPC

## The Solution to Player Rejoin Voting

This is the **FINAL FIXED** version that properly saves votes and prevents players from voting again after rejoining the server.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Player Rejoin Issue**: Players can no longer vote again after rejoining the server
2. **Data Storage Format**: Changed how player votes are stored to be fully compatible with DataStore
3. **UserID Tracking**: Now properly tracks players using string UserIDs for better DataStore compatibility
4. **Persistent Vote Counts**: Vote counts are fully persistent between server sessions
5. **Player Join Notification**: Added logging when a player joins to show their previous vote status

## How It Works

The system now uses DataStore more effectively:

1. **String Keys**: All UserIDs are stored as strings (DataStore doesn't handle numeric keys well)
2. **Complete Vote History**: The entire voting history is saved and loaded from DataStore
3. **Player Memory**: When a player rejoins, the system remembers their previous vote
4. **Join Detection**: The system detects when a player joins and notes if they have voted before
5. **Data Verification**: Regular checks ensure vote counts match the actual voter data

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clean Up Everything

Remove ALL existing voting scripts from:
- The NPC model
- StarterPlayerScripts
- ServerScriptService
- Any other locations

### Step 2: Install the New Fixed Server Script

1. Download [VotingNPC_PersistenceFix.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TopStrixStudios/RobloxVotingNPC/main/VotingNPC_PersistenceFix.lua)
2. Place it **INSIDE your NPC model** (not in ServerScriptService)
3. Rename it to just `VotingNPC` (remove _PersistenceFix)
4. Make sure your NPC model has a PrimaryPart (HumanoidRootPart)

### Step 3: Keep Using the Same Client Script

Continue using your existing client script in StarterPlayerScripts.

## Important Notes on Testing

1. **Studio Testing**: When testing in Studio, be sure to enable "API Services" (otherwise DataStore won't work)
2. **Vote Persistence**: Votes are saved even when players leave the game
3. **Cooldown**: The 10-second cooldown for changing votes still applies
4. **Different DataStore**: This version uses a new DataStore key (V2) to prevent conflicts with old data

## How to Verify It's Working

When a player rejoins the server, you should see a message in the Output similar to:
```
[PlayerName] joined with existing vote: Like
```
or
```
[PlayerName] joined with no previous vote
```

If they have voted before, when they click the NPC, they will see their current vote highlighted in the menu, and they will need to wait for the cooldown to expire before changing it.

## Customization

You can configure various settings at the top of the script:

```lua
-- CONFIGURATION
local VOTE_COOLDOWN = 10 -- Seconds before a player can change their vote
local DISPLAY_VISIBILITY_DISTANCE = 25 -- Maximum distance to see the display (studs)
local HOLOGRAM_HEIGHT = 3.5 -- Height above NPC
local UPDATE_INTERVAL = 0.5 -- How often to refresh the display
local AUTO_SAVE_INTERVAL = 60 -- How often to auto-save vote data (seconds)
```

## Multiple NPCs

If you have multiple voting NPCs, give each NPC model a unique ID attribute:

```lua
npcModel:SetAttribute("NPCId", "LobbyVotingNPC")
```

This ensures each NPC has its own separate vote data.
